SYNOPSIS

INTRODUCTION
Writing your feelings on a paper is the best kind of therapy ..but a paper and a pen cannot be accessed everywhere but what if the diary is on your phone? 
users can surely use a notepad or a similar application to achieve this task but would their entries be oragnised ? Are thier entries safe and saved as such no one else can access 
This can be achieved by'SENTIMENT DIARY' which will allow the users to write thier entries on the application itself the entries they made would be saved and stored and each entrie's 
content would be analysed to identify emotions and categorise each entry as positive,negative,or neutral.
