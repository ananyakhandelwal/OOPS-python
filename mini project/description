PROJECT TITLE : SENTIMENT DIARY
Objective:
The "Sentiment Diary" project is a Python-based application designed to analyze the sentiment of peoples daily diary entries. 
By using natural language processing techniques, this program classifies each diary entry as Positive, Negative,
or Neutral. hence providing users with a dataset of their emotional well being on day to day basis to analyse their
mental state throughout a period of time . 

Description:
The Sentiment Diary serves as an innovative tool for individuals to track and analyze their emotional well-being through 
their diary entries. The program allows users to input text entries, which are processed using sentiment analysis 
algorithms. Based on the tone, vocabulary, and context of the input provided , the application assigns a sentiment label to 
each entry.

FEATURES:
User-Friendly Input:
Users can write their diary entries directly into the application.

SENTIMENT ANALYSIS:
The program uses text analysis to identify emotions conveyed in the diary entries.
Entries are categorized as:
Positive: When the text conveys happiness, gratitude, or optimism.
Negative: When the text reflects sadness, anger, or frustration.
Neutral: When the text is balanced or lacks strong emotional cues.

INSIGHTS:
Helps users recognize patterns in their emotions over time.
Encourages emotional awareness and growth
IMPLEMENTATION:
 -> PYTHON LIBRARIES USED :
     ->TextBlob: For sentiment classification.
     -> JSON: For storing and managing diary entries 

 -> How It Works:
The users will write or paste their diary entries into the input field.
The text is preprocessed by removing unnecessary symbols and stop words (if needed).
lastly, Sentiment analysis algorithms evaluate the entry.
The classified sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) is displayed to the user.

Benefits:
Encourages regular journaling by providing engaging feedback.
Helps users reflect on their emotional health.
Useful for personal development and mindfulness practices.
Conclusion:
The Sentiment Diary is a simple yet impactful tool that combines the therapeutic practice of journaling with
modern technology. this will empower users to gain better self-awareness and emotional intelligence by understanding
the underlying sentiment of their daily thoughts.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
1) creating a more interractive application which responds to the sentiment analysis better 
for example :
diary entry input : "I feel great today , as i ate my mothers food after a month when i got back home from hostel."
output : "that's good you held out pretty well for a whole month. keep going.".

2) A simple and friendly hardcover book like user interface .
3) pass word protected
